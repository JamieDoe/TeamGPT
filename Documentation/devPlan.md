# Design & Project Documentation

## Initial Plan

### 1.1 Product description

* Group chat app that allows for users to chat and use chatgpt in the same server.
* Users can work together and prompt chatgpt in same chat.
* Aims to allow for groups to rapidly develop projects via companionship with the help of a GPT.

### 1.2 Project application domain

#### Who is our target audience and why?

* Who would our customers be?
  * Customers are everything.
  * 'Will the dog eat the dog food'!
* Why would they use it?
* How would it benifit them?
* What pain points would it solve?

#### Medium complexity with 3 distinct components

#### Graphical User Interface GUI

* Users will need a way to interact with the website, thus an intuatuve GUI will be required.
* The GUI should alow for users to easily chat with friends, collogues or asociates with ease.
* Users should have an accessible way to prompt the GPT.
* Users should also be able to create new chat rooms, access old chat rooms and archive old chats.
* The GUI will be created using HTML & CSS.

#### Logic

* The logic behind the application will serve as the brains allowing the app to function correclty.
* All of the chat functionality will be served by this 'logic'.
* User account creation will also be performed by the logic.
* The programming language for the logic of the application is still to be confirmed. Initial ideas:
  * Javascript
    * ReactJS
    * NextJS

#### Storage

* A form of storage will be required to store archived chats and user information.
* Chats could potentially be stored via cookies and thus might not require an external database.
* If a database is required, it will be created in a form of SQL langauge.
